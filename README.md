# Ask-a-Manager-Survey
The data for this project was obtained from a popular blog known as "Ask A Manager" https://www.askamanager.org. A survey posted on this blog asked readers from around the world to anonymously fill out how much money they were making.
The goal for this project is to clean up the data and perform some exploratory data analysis and gain some insights like regional disparities between people with the same age, same title, different country among other insights.
